Oh man, working on that project was great. As a kid of the 90’s my dream was to pick up the torch after Peyo would stop drawing, altough I didn’t know he was already gone at that time. I spent days drawing Smurfs on primary school benches, and today I’m fulfilled having the honor to be the lead UX/UI designer for their rights acquisition platform. Against all odds, they allowed me to use a lot a material and create a playful design, event though it is a B2B website. 

Development issues let us no other choice than narrowing the templates details, but it was still really fun. Here are the early detailed designs.
