Some time ago, two belgian companies merged into a big one. From that fusion grew the will of having a proper, unique identity. That’s why SPMT and Arista have thought of an internal brainstorming to come up with a new name for the company. « A Name For The Future » is the very first brick of what will become a fresh start for everyone. 

Planned in four steps, employees will be put to contribution around discussion tables and votes. In the same time, an emailing campaign keeps everybody in the loop and shares progress results. 

Here you can see the 2nd step of the process and the single page that come with it.
