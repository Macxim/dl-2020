This ambitious project of opening his first parapharmacy was a great experience. After the logo was created and the guidelines in hand, my objective was to perfectly translate the ambiance to the web and deliver an eshop that would be easy to browse. 

I communicated a lot with the designer in charge of the brand identity and gathered strength to take my best shot. In the end the shop opening was a success and the client was delighted.
