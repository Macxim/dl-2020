What a joy to work with beer-related brand assets, especially when some cold ones are waiting in the fridge. I was involved in this project when the two founders of the Brasserie Lion brewery were happy with the print work made by my colleagues. 

After that, I had to recreate the same feeling on screen through many, tiny details tailored as sparkly layout. They were closely looking at how the animation would be made, which brought me and the developers to work together tightly.
