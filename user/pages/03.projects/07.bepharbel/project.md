This is a quick shot made in a two-hours session for prospection. I eventually came up with something really interesting, playing with patterns and elegant fonts to reassure the user. 

The action range was pretty wide, the logo being the only identity information I had. Colors and fonts were to be chosen by me, which is always a thrilling choice decision. It made me realise how important those kind of exercice are, and could help staying efficient on last-minutes requests.
