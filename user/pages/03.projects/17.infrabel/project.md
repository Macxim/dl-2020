“The sound that will save you”. This campaign website launched by Infrabel aims to inform residents of the change of the ringing bell at the railroad crossing signals in Belgium.
This public campaign was made to prevent people accident on the belgian rails, which happens too often on the belgian rail network.

Using a comfortable visual language and a mobile first approach, I built a one-page design with easy access to information. I didn’t forget to honor our special guest, Arno himself!
