The belgian Red-Cross needed a small website to gather reservations for plasma donations. The idea was to advise people about it and invite them to donate. 

A friendly tone was made by putting some testimonials, bright colors and colorful images, and on top of that a bit of playfulness was added by rotating primary buttons.
