GSA Healthcare is a consulting and services company dedicated to the healthcare industries in France and Belgium. Lifetouch is be a side-service they will provide to create a better communication between pharmacist and sales managers. My mission was to create a logo and a small visual identity to quickly design the drugs ordering interface, which I didn’t include here to keep informations private. 

The global feeling was meant to be comforting and easy to read, since the target isn’t really used to web interfaces. Based on the idea of smile, I designed subtle curves and user clever images to create a welcoming feeling.
