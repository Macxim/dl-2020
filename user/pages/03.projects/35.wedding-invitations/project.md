This is not a web project, but I was proud the have the chance to design invitations for a friend who was getting married. Calligraphy, purple and cats were the main guidelines. It was a great project that magnified one of the most important day of their lives. 

If you’re carefully looking, you’ll notice he’s the one helped me develop this website!
