## 今日は、I’m Denis.

I have a passion about design, and that led me to explore this wide, marvellous range of possibilities. From the early days of my journey, I have tried various applications of it such as logo creation, motion and graphic design, illustration, and finally found myself completely fulfilled with user-interface and user-experience design. Since that day, I have spent all my time triying to get better and master web ergonomics.

Along 6 years of experience I had the honor to work for the likes of brands such as Amnesty International, Easyfairs, Partenamut, Infrabel, Croix-Rouge, Ortis, or the Smurfs. 

Passionate about technology and languages, I aim at improve myself constantly by staying curious about everything.
